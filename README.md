Ladies-First Rap Project

This is one of my most favorite projects to date! I created a female rap api which includes bio information about various rap artists, and a song/video of theirs as a tribute. Some artists include: Nicki Minaj, Cardi B, Eve, and many more.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Heroku, Express

I'm still playing around with the functionality of Node.js and decided to sprinkle in some Express to speed up functionality and also reduce the amount of code. I am still amazed at the things we can do as developers such as writing server side code. It was cool to combine my love of music with technology.

For this project, I collaborated with software developer, Nora @noravgs (on Github/Twitter). I created the API, Nora hosted the project on Heroku, and we both contributed to the UI.

Lessons Learned:
I'm still learning my way around Heroku but I am really enjoying Express. The biggest challenge for me in this project was adding the videos to the api, after some brainstorming, I felt that it may be easier to host the videos and then link to them in the API. It would've been a much smaller file size if I could've linked directly to the youtube videos but I'm assuming since it's music, it wasn't allowed. I tried practicing with random tutorial Youtube videos (which worked) but each time I would attempt to link to a music video, it would read "Video Unavailable".

Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
